# Who are we?

We are a place where ideas shape ideas, where there is no boundary between disciplines and methods

# What do we do?

- Transdisciplinary research (Got curious? Check 
[here](https://www.arj.no/2012/03/12/disciplinarities-2/) and 
[here](http://balance-unbalance2017.org/events/transdisciplinary-research-why-is-it-still-so-rare-and-why-should-we-care/)!)

- Meta-science research and development of alternative forms of scientific organizations

- Maximization of distribution of knowledge, scientific methods, and creativity

# What are our goals?

We aim to create a horizontally transferable lab that could be replicated by anyone and anywhere
