This is the first post of the Formozoli Lab Project, and it is going to be neither long nor important: It is just a way to show off and to check that everything works correctly!

This code below doesn't mean anything but I just keep it not to forget about it:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
